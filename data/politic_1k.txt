political question ||| in american constitutional law , the political question doctrine is closely linked to the concept of justiciability , as it comes down to a question of whether or not the court system is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case . this is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question , not a political question . legal questions are deemed to be justiciable , while political questions are nonjusticiable . one scholar explained : the political question doctrine holds that some questions , in their nature , are fundamentally political , and not legal , and if a question is fundamentally political ... then the court will refuse to hear that case . it will claim that it does nt have jurisdiction . and it will leave that question to some other aspect of the political process to settle out . a ruling of nonjusticiability will ultimately prohibit the issue that is bringing the case before the court from being able to be heard in a court of law . in the typical case where there is a finding of nonjusticiability due to the political question doctrine , the issue presented before the court is usually so specific that the constitution gives all power to one of the coordinate political branches , or at the opposite end of the spectrum , the issue presented is so vague that the united states constitution does not even consider it . a court can only decide issues based on law . the constitution dictates the different legal responsibilities of each respective branch of government . if there is an issue where the court does not have the constitution as a guide , there are no legal criteria to use . when there are no specific constitutional duties involved , the issue is to be decided through the democratic process . the court will not engage in political disputes . a constitutional dispute that requires knowledge of a non legal character or the use of techniques not suitable for a court or explicitly assigned by the constitution to the u.s. congress , or the president of the united states , is a political question , which judges customarily refuse to address .

libertarian science fiction ||| libertarian science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on the politics and social order implied by right libertarian philosophies with an emphasis on individualism and private ownership of the means of productionand in some cases , no state whatsoever . as a category , libertarian fiction is unusual because the vast majority of its authors are self identified as science fiction authors . this contrasts with the authors of much other social criticism who are largely academic or mainstream novelists who tend to dismiss any genre classification . the identification between libertarianism and science fiction is so strong that the u.s. libertarian party often has representatives at science fiction conventions and one of the highest profile authors currently in the subgenre of libertarian science fiction , l. neil smith , was the arizona libertarian party s <N> candidate for the president of the united states . as a genre , it can be seen as growing out of the <N> s and <N> s when the science fiction pulp magazines were reaching their peak at the same time as fascism and communism . while this environment gave rise to dystopian novels , in the pulps , this influence more often give rise to speculations about societies ( or sub groups ) arising in direct opposition to totalitarianism . ayn rand s novel atlas shrugged is a strong ( perhaps the strongest ) influence with an anti socialist attitude and an individualist ethic that echoes throughout the genre . of more direct relevance to the science fiction end of this genre is robert a. heinlein s the moon is a harsh mistress , which is highly regarded even by non libertarian science fiction readers . an award for libertarian science fiction , the prometheus award , is given out every year . some winners of the award identify as libertarians ( e.g. , l. neil smith , victor koman , brad linaweaver ) , while others do not ( terry pratchett , charles stross ) . some other prominent libertarian science fiction authors include s. andrew swann and michael z. williamson .

gangsta rap ||| gangsta rap or gangster rap is a subgenre of hip hop music with themes and lyrics that generally emphasize the gangsta lifestyle . the genre evolved from hardcore hip hop into a distinct form , pioneered in the mid <N> s by rappers such as schoolly d and ice t , and was popularized in the later part of the <N> s by groups like n.w.a . after the national attention that ice t and n.w.a attracted in the late <N> s and early <N> s , gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop . many ( if not most ) gangsta rap artists openly boast of their associations with various active street gangs as part of their artistic image , with the bloods and crips being the most commonly represented . gangsta rap is closely related to other indigenous gang and crime oriented forms of music , such as the narcocorrido genre of northern mexico . the subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy . criticism has come from both left wing and right wing commentators , as well as religious leaders , who have accused the genre of promoting crime , serial killing , murder , violence , profanity , sex addiction , homophobia , racism , promiscuity , misogyny , rape , street gangs , disorderly conduct , drive by shootings , vandalism , thievery , driving under the influence , drug dealing , alcohol abuse , substance abuse , disregarding law enforcement , materialism , and narcissism . the white house administrations of both george h. w. bush and bill clinton criticized the genre . many black rappersincluding ice t and sister souljahcontend that they are being unfairly singled out because their music reflects deep changes in society not being addressed anywhere else in the public forum . the white politicians , the artists complain , neither understand the music nor desire to hear what s going on in the devastated communities that gave birth to the art form , wrote journalist chuck philips in a review of the battle between the establishment and defenders of rap music . the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture ... what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in american politics . the problem here is that the white house and wanna bes like bill clinton represent a political system

august weismann ||| for the <N> th century new york politician , see augustus weismann . august friedrich leopold weismann ( <N> january <N> november <N> ) was a german evolutionary biologist . ernst mayr ranked him as the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the <N> th century , after charles darwin . weismann became the director of the zoological institute and the first professor of zoology at freiburg . his main contribution involved germ plasm theory , at one time also known as weismannism , according to which inheritance ( in a multicellular organism ) only takes place by means of the germ cellsthe gametes such as egg cells and sperm cells . other cells of the bodysomatic cellsdo not function as agents of heredity . the effect is one way : germ cells produce somatic cells and are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or therefore any ability an individual acquires during its life . genetic information can not pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation . biologists refer to this concept as the weismann barrier . this idea , if true , rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by jean baptiste lamarck . the idea of the weismann barrier is central to the modern synthesis of the early <N> th century , though scholars do not express it today in the same terms . in weismann s opinion the largely random process of mutation , which must occur in the gametes ( or stem cells that make them ) is the only source of change for natural selection to work on . weismann became one of the first biologists to deny lamarckism entirely . weismann s ideas preceded the rediscovery of gregor mendel s work , and though weismann was cagey about accepting mendelism , younger workers soon made the connection . weismann is much admired today . ernst mayr judged him to be the most important evolutionary thinker between darwin and the evolutionary synthesis around <N> , and one of the great biologists of all time .

anarcho syndicalism ||| anarcho syndicalism ( also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism ) is a theory of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and , with that control , influence broader society . syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self activity and as an alternative co operative economic system with democratic values and production centered on meeting human needs . the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are solidarity , direct action ( action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians , bureaucrats , and arbitrators ) and direct democracy , or workers self management . the end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system , regarding it as wage slavery . anarcho syndicalist theory therefore generally focuses on the labour movement . anarcho syndicalists view the primary purpose of the state as being the defence of private property , and therefore of economic , social , and political privilege , denying most of its denizens the ability to enjoy material independence and the social autonomy that springs from it . in contrast with other bodies of thought , particularly with marxismleninism , anarcho syndicalists deny the possibility of a workers state , or a state that acts in the interests of workers , as opposed to those of the powerful , and posit that any state with the intention of empowering the workers will inevitably work to empower itself or the existing elite at the expense of the workers . reflecting the anarchist philosophy from which it draws its primary inspiration , anarcho syndicalism is centred around the idea that power corrupts and that any hierarchy that can not be ethically justified must either be dismantled or replaced by decentralized egalitarian control .

spin ( propaganda ) ||| in public relations and politics , spin is a form of propaganda , achieved through providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to persuade public opinion in favor or against some organization or public figure . while traditional public relations and advertising may also rely on altering the presentation of the facts , spin often implies the use of disingenuous , deceptive , and highly manipulative tactics . because of the frequent association between spin and press conferences ( especially government press conferences ) , the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a spin room . public relations advisors , pollsters and media consultants who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as spin doctors or spinmeisters . spin is typically applied to events or situations which are deemed to be unfavourable or potentially harmful to the popularity of a person , brand or product . as such , a standard tactic used in spinning is to reframe , reposition , or otherwise modify the perception of an issue or event , to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion . for example , a company whose top selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may reframe the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor s products or indeed by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category . this might be done using a catchy slogan or sound bite that can help to persuade the public of the company s biased point of view . this tactic could enable the company to defocus the public s attention on the negative aspects of its product . as it takes experience and training to spin an issue , spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media consultants . the largest and most powerful companies may have in house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues . while spin is often considered to be a private sector tactic , in the <N> s and <N> s , some politicians and political staff have been accused by their opponents of using deceptive spin tactics to manipulate public opinion or deceive the public . spin approaches used by some political teams include burying potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend ; selectively cherry picking quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that

httatal ||| the httatal ( old norse pronunciation [ htatal ] , icelandic pronunciation : [ hautatal ] , conversation of meters ; c. <N> , <N> words ) is the last section of the prose edda composed by the icelandic poet , politician , and historian snorri sturluson . using , for the most part , his own compositions , it exemplifies the types of verse forms used in old norse poetry . snorri took a prescriptive as well as descriptive approach ; he has systematized the material , and often notes that the older poets did not always follow his rules . most of the forms depend on number of syllables per line , as well as assonance , consonance , and alliteration . although end rhyme is represented , it does not function in the ways most modern english speakers expect ( forms include aaaaaaaa , and aaaabbbb ) , and plays a very minor role . understanding this work will be much easier if the first grammatical treatise is also available to hand . many scholars have suggested that the form of httatal suggests a classical influence deriving from the traditions of christian learning to which snorri was doubtlessly exposed . others have argued that this is a result of using a logical approach , within the framework of a dialog , and that some aspects of the work prove that it was not directly influenced by classical writings .

bona dea ||| bona dea ( [ b.na de.a ] the good goddess ) was a divinity in ancient roman religion . she was associated with chastity and fertility in roman women , healing , and the protection of the state and people . according to roman literary sources , she was brought from magna graecia at some time during the early or middle republic , and was given her own state cult on the aventine hill . her rites allowed women the use of strong wine and blood sacrifice , things otherwise forbidden them by roman tradition . men were barred from her mysteries and the possession of her true name . given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes , ancient speculations about her identity abound , among them that she was an aspect of terra , ops , cybele , or ceres , or a latin form of the greek goddess damia . most often , she was identified as the wife , sister or daughter of the god faunus , thus an equivalent or aspect of the nature goddess fauna , who could prophesy the fates of women . the goddess had two annual festivals . one was held at her aventine temple ; the other was hosted by the wife of rome s senior annual magistrate for an invited group of elite matrons and female attendants . the latter festival came to scandalous prominence in <N> bc , when the politician publius clodius pulcher was tried for his intrusion on the rites , allegedly bent on the seduction of julius caesar s wife , whom caesar later divorced because caesar s wife must be above suspicion . the rites remained a subject of male curiosity and speculation , both religious and prurient . bona dea s cults in the city of rome were led by the vestal virgins , and her provincial cults by virgin or matron priestesses . surviving statuary shows her as a sedate roman matron with a cornucopia and a snake . personal dedications to her are attested among all classes , especially plebeians , freedmen and women , and slaves . approximately one third of her dedications are from men , some of whom may have been lawfully involved in her cult .

chartism ||| chartism was a working class movement for political reform in britain that existed from <N> to <N> . it took its name from the people s charter of <N> and was a national protest movement , with particular strongholds of support in northern england , the east midlands , the staffordshire potteries , the black country , and the south wales valleys . support for the movement was at its highest in <N> , <N> , and <N> , when petitions signed by millions of working people were presented to the house of commons . the strategy employed was to use the scale of support which these petitions and the accompanying mass meetings demonstrated to put pressure on politicians to concede manhood suffrage . chartism thus relied on constitutional methods to secure its aims , though there were some who became involved in insurrectionary activities , notably in south wales and in yorkshire . the people s charter called for six reforms to make the political system more democratic : a vote for every man ( earlier , every person but this was dropped due to middle class pressure ) twenty one years of age , of sound mind , and not undergoing punishment for a crime . the secret ballot to protect the elector in the exercise of his vote . no property qualification for members of parliament in order to allow the constituencies to return the man of their choice . payment of members , enabling tradesmen , working men , or other persons of modest means to leave or interrupt their livelihood to attend to the interests of the nation . equal constituencies , securing the same amount of representation for the same number of electors , instead of allowing less populous constituencies to have as much or more weight than larger ones . annual parliamentary elections , thus presenting the most effectual check to bribery and intimidation , since no purse could buy a constituency under a system of universal manhood suffrage in each twelve month period . chartists saw themselves fighting against political corruption and for democracy in an industrial society , but attracted support beyond the radical political groups for economic reasons , such as opposing wage cuts and unemployment .

the prince ||| the prince ( italian : il principe [ il printipe ] ) is a <N> th century political treatise by the italian diplomat and political theorist niccol machiavelli . from correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in <N> , using a latin title , de principatibus ( about principalities ) . however , the printed version was not published until <N> , five years after machiavelli s death . this was done with the permission of the medici pope clement vii , but long before then , in fact since the first appearance of the prince in manuscript , controversy had swirled about his writings . although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style , it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative . this is only partly because it was written in the vernacular italian rather than latin , a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of dante s divine comedy and other works of renaissance literature . the prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy , especially modern political philosophy , in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal . it was also in direct conflict with the dominant catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning politics and ethics . although it is relatively short , the treatise is the most remembered of machiavelli s works and the one most responsible for bringing the word machiavellian into usage as a pejorative . it even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words politics and politician in western countries . in terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer discourses on livy , which was written a few years later . in its use of near contemporary italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for politics , another lesser known work by machiavelli which the prince has been compared to is the life of castruccio castracani . the descriptions within the prince have the general theme of accepting that the aims of princes such as glory and survival can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends : he who neglects what is done for what ought to be done , sooner effects his ruin than his preservation .
